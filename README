Introduction

   Umit is a network scanning frontend.

   Umit is developed in the Python programming language, and its
   interface is built with the GTK Toolkit. It's also worth to mention
   that the initial development is sponsored by Google's Summer of Code.

   The project goal is to develop a network scanning frontend that is really
   useful for advanced users and easy to be used by newbies. With Umit, a
   network admin can create scan profiles for faster and easier network
   scanning and even compare scan results to easily see any changes. New
   users can also construct powerful scans with Umit command creator
   wizard.

Installation

   Umit is available for multiple platforms. It has been successfully
   tested on the following platforms/flavors:
     * Ubuntu 5.04 Hoary Hedgeog
     * Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4
     * OpenBSD 3.7
     * Microsoft Windows 2000
     * Microsoft Windows XP
     * Apple MacOS X 10.4 (Tiger)

   The installation instructions are somewhat different for each
   platform.

Default (source) Installation

   The Umit's source package are provided in such a way that, if you have
   all the required software, it will run 'out-of-the-tarball'.

   The list of required software follows:
     * [1]Python 2.4 or higher
     * [2]GTK+ 2.6 or higher
     * [3]PyGTK 2.6 or higher
     * [4]nmap itself and its requirements
     * [5]PySQLite2
     * [10]Psyco (optional)

   After unpacking the source distribution do one of the following:
     * Double click the umit file
     * Call the Python interpreter on the umit file

GNU/Linux Installation

   Unpack the source package, and get inside the extracted directory.

   # Extracting  gziped tarball
   $ tar xvzf umit-0.9.1.tar.gz

   # Extracting bziped tarball
   $ tar xvjf umit-0.9.1.tar.bz2

   # Extracting ziped source
   $ unzip umit-0.9.1.zip


   After extracting the sources, get inside the extracted dir:
   $ cd umit-0.9.1

   And then, run the command bellow as root:
   # python setup.py install


   This should be enough to get Umit installed.
   To run Umit:
   $ umit

   
   If you want to define the path where Umit should be installed, do:
   $ python setup.py install --prefix /path/to/umit_dir

   After that, put the /path/to/umit_dir/bin directory created in your PATH:
   $ export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/umit_dir/bin

   Or, put line above inside your ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bashrc or ~/.profile
   (depending on your system) and this will get executed everytime you login.
   After putting the bin directory in the PATH, execute Umit:
   $ umit.pyw
