    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>
      The idea of the NSE facilitator is to provide a better integration of 
      <application>Umit</application>, <application>Nmap</application> and 
      <application>NSE</application> in such a way that even a newbie could easilly run 
      and share scripts with a few clicks, instead of finding them in the web, 
      downloading, reading documentation to know how to use it with Nmap and 
      running a long command to be able to use it.
