    distinct scan results, highlighting any difference that may occour between
    one to another in a easy to read manner. This feature is intended to let you compare
    two given scans, let's say one made in the morning and other made in the evening, and not
    if in the mean time a given host has left the network, or if a given host is still serving
    on the same port as in the morning, for example. It can be really usefull for network
    administrators, as with regular scans of it's network can be compared to show abnormalities.
    </p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="open_instruc"></a>Openning Instructions</h3></div></div></div><p>To reach the Compare Results Window, make sure that <span class="application">Umit</span> 
      is open, and then do one of  the following:</p><div class="procedure"><a name="id2522191"></a><p class="title"><b>Procedure 1. Use the key-stroke</b></p><ul><li>The key-stroke that shows the Compare Results Window is 
	<span class="accel">CTRL + D</span>.</li></ul></div><div class="procedure"><a name="id2522207"></a><p class="title"><b>Procedure 2. Single click on the Compare Results Icon in the Main Toolbar</b></p><ul><li>The Compare Results Icon in the Main Toolbar may differ from theme to theme, but 
	it is always the <span class="guibutton">6th icon counting from left to right.</span></li></ul></div><div class="procedure"><a name="id2522224"></a><p class="title"><b>Procedure 3. Access from the Main Menu</b></p><ul><li>Go to the <span class="emphasis"><em>Main Menu</em></span> (the one on the top of the application),
	<span class="guimenu">File</span>-&gt;<span class="guimenuitem">Compare Results</span>.</li></ul></div></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2522254"></a>Loaded/Loading Results</h2></div></div></div><p>To avoid too much user interaction, and usability problems, 
    <span class="application">Umit</span> automatically make available at the <span class="emphasis"><em>Compare 
    Results Window</em></span> combo boxes, the scan results currently loaded in the 
    main interface. As you may have already noted, scans are loaded separatedly inside scan
    tabs, that are describe with a title that may be the scan result file name, a combination 
    of the Profile Name + Target used in the scan or something else. Thoose scan tabs titles, 
    are used as identifiers that loads the respective scan result for comparison when 
    selected at those combo boxes.</p><p>If one or both of the scan results that you wish to compare are not loaded in 
    <span class="application">Umit's</span> main interface, you can compare then by loading then 
    inside the <span class="emphasis"><em>Compare Results Window</em></span> without the need of closing the
    window, loading the results into scan tabs, and then openning the <span class="emphasis"><em>Compare 
    Results Window</em></span> again. To load then directly, use the <span class="guibutton">Open</span>
    button that resides on the right of each combo box.</p><p>You may also want to compare results that are not saved into files, but inside the
    <span class="application">Umit's</span> search data base. To load those results, you'll have 
    to load then into scan tabs first, and then open the <span class="emphasis"><em>Compare Results 
    Window</em></span> to compare them. It's a bit cumbersome, but loading then directly 
    from the <span class="emphasis"><em>Compare Results Window</em></span> would implicate on creating 
    more widgets inside the window and making it more complex, thus lowing it's 
    usability anyway.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2478395"></a>Comparing Results</h2></div></div></div><p>To quickly start comparing two given resuls, simply select the results you wish to 
    compare at the &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>Scan Result 1</em></span></span>&#8221; and 
    &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>Scan Result 2</em></span></span>&#8221; combo boxes. The only thing you 
    should pay attention while selecting the scan results, is that the comparison is 
    done by highlighting what has changed (or is not present) in the second result when 
    compared to the first one. So, if you chage the order of the scan results selection, 
    you'll end up with a different comparison result, that probably won't show what you're 
    looking for.</p><p>If you just want to compare changes on your network, a simple rule that won't let you
    get in trouble always select the older result first, and then the newest one. By following 
    this, you'll get a comparison that shows which hosts has left your network in the mean time,
    or, which ports appeared or disappeared, etc. By selecting the newest one first, you'll have
    a not so usefull comparison.
    </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"></div><p>Let's say that you have two different scans loaded in <span class="application">Umit</span>,
    and you wish to compare then. The first one, called &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>Quick Scan on 
    192.168.204.128</em></span></span>&#8221; is a scan result made 2 days ago, and the second 
    one, called &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>Regular Scan on 192.168.204.128</em></span></span>&#8221; is 
    a just finished scan result. The goal is to verify if something has changed during this
    2 days, like if a service has been put up, or down in the mean while.</p><p>Having those scans already loaded, simply open the <span class="emphasis"><em>Compare Results 
    Window</em></span>, by following <a href="#open_instruc" title="Openning Instructions">the section called &#8220;Openning Instructions&#8221;</a> mentioned in the 
    beginning. Doing so, you'll end up with a window like this:</p><div class="screenshot"><div align="center"><img src="screenshots/comparing_results1.png" align="middle"></div></div><p>The screenshot above shows the appearance of the <span class="emphasis"><em>Compare Results 
    Window</em></span> running the &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>Compare Mode</em></span></span>&#8221;
    just after it's openning.</p><p>At <span class="emphasis"><em>Scan Result 1</em></span> combo box, select &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>Quick Scan on 
    192.168.204.128</em></span></span>&#8221; and at <span class="emphasis"><em>Scan Result 2</em></span>, select 
    &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>Regular Scan on 192.168.204.128</em></span></span>&#8221;. In the moment you 
    finish the selection of the results you want to compare, <span class="application">Umit</span>
    detects your choices and generates automatically the comparison result.</p><div class="screenshot"><div align="center"><img src="screenshots/comparing_results2.png" align="middle"></div></div><p>The <span class="emphasis"><em>Compare Results Window</em></span> with selected results and the

    if you are a new user, you will probably be questionning why there is a 
    &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>Text mode</em></span></span>&#8221;, if you've got the &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>Compare 
    mode</em></span></span>&#8221;, that is easier to read and understand. Here goes the answer: 
    The &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>Text mode</em></span></span>&#8221; is the first comparison mode, and it's
    quite usefull in some situations. If you simply want to visually compare two different scans,
    the &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>Compare mode</em></span></span>&#8221; is just what you need. But, if you need
    to report changes and save them for historical purposes, the &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>Text 
    mode</em></span></span>&#8221; will generate for you a text diff that can be copied and pasted
    anywhere. This mode is not so complete as the &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>Compare 
    mode</em></span></span>&#8221;, but it's the only one that you can save for latter analysis. In the 
    future, <span class="application">Umit</span> will feature a report generation tool, to ease this
    task.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2479055"></a>Reading and Understanding</h3></div></div></div><p>The text diff is basically the first result plus extra lines that describes what

      Those colors are describe as <span class="emphasis"><em>Property was Added</em></span> and

      you'll have a more intuitive experience, as you won't have to bother about
